knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Question A

First I run the dataset and save it in my environment. 
```{r dataset, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
monarchs <- read_delim(here("monarchs_clean.csv"))
```

Next up is piping it and creating a ggplot containing the duration of reign for the different monarchs
```{r plotting, eval = TRUE}
monarchs %>% 
  select(Monarch, Reign_Start_Year, Reign_duration) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Monarch,Reign_Start_Year), y = Reign_duration))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Reign duration", x = "Monarch", y = "Duration")+ 
  coord_flip()
```
